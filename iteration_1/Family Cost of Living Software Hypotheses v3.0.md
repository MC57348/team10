Accepted hypothesis

The software needs to meet the needs of different types of families, including middle-class families, single-income families, and so on.

Evidence: The questionnaire survey showed that respondents came from a variety of family types, including family sizes ranging from 3-7 people, with monthly incomes ranging from 2,000 to 200,000.

Families need personalized financial planning tools that allow them to easily enter and track various household expenses.

Evidence: In the questionnaire, the majority of respondents (11/16) indicated a need for such a tool.

Households want to manage budgets and expenses anytime, anywhere via mobile apps.

Evidence: In the feature preference, 12/16 respondents chose this feature.

Households want the flexibility to adjust spending in different categories without exceeding their total budget.

Evidence: 8/16 respondents chose this feature, which is not overwhelming, but still a significant percentage of demand.

Households want personalized money-saving advice, including information on discounts, coupons and promotions.

Evidence: 9/16 respondents chose this feature.

Households trust recommendations and reviews from other similar households.

Evidence: The majority of respondents (14/16) indicated a willingness to share money-saving tips and discoveries on the platform or to learn good practices from other families.

Families would like to access the service through mobile and web applications.

Evidence: In interviews, respondents mentioned the need for mobile apps and web applications.

Disproved hypothesis

Households are willing to pay subscription fees for high quality personal financial management services.

Evidence: The questionnaire shows that only 6/16 respondents are willing to pay a subscription fee and most prefer free services.

Households want software that securely integrates their bank account and credit card information to automatically track spending.

Evidence: While 9/16 of respondents agreed with this, a significant number expressed concern. One interviewee specifically mentioned concerns about the security of credit card information.

Families want to easily plan and save for large future expenses (e.g., education, vacations, home purchases).

Evidence: Only 6/16 respondents chose this feature, which is not a strong enough demand.

Households want healthy and affordable recommendations for food and household items.

Evidence: Only 3/16 respondents chose this feature, which is a low demand.

Hypotheses for further testing

Households value information and advice received through social media and financial bloggers/experts.

Evidence: The questionnaire results show a fragmented preference for different sources of information and more data is needed to determine this.

Families want to engage in community interaction and sharing, but also require strong privacy controls.

Evidence: While most people are willing to share experiences, specific privacy requirements need to be further investigated.
